### Whenever we start a new project we need to create a new Environment

### We need to Create and Environment from Scratch and then we can start Implementing

### Whatever code or whatever end to end project we are creating we will do it in that specific environment

# As Per Norms we should create a new environment whenever we create a new environment

```
conda create -p venv python==3.7 -y
```

```
venv -- Environment Name
```

```
-y -- for explicitly Confirming Yes to the installation
```

## Very Important is to install anaconda first and then set the path variables according to the installation

## otherwise when creating an environment and when activation it will create errors
